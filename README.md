# PERSONALBLOG-

## Description

Welcome to **PERSONALBLOG-**, a simple, clean, and functional personal blog site where you can share your thoughts and experiences. Whether you're a student, marketer, or just someone who loves writing, this platform allows you to create and display blog posts effortlessly.

This two-page site features a form for creating blog entries and a dynamic posts page that displays all the blogs. You can switch between light and dark modes depending on your vibe, and all posts are safely stored in localStorage, so you don’t lose any of your creative content.

## Features

- **Create a Blog Post:** Use the form on the landing page to enter your username, blog title, and blog content.
- **Validation Alerts:** Ensure all fields are filled out. If not, a prompt will remind you to complete the form.
- **LocalStorage for Persistence:** Your blog posts are stored in `localStorage`, so they’re safe from refreshes.
- **Dynamic Blog Post Display:** Once submitted, blog posts are rendered on the posts page, showing your thoughts in full glory.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Customize your reading and writing experience with a light or dark theme.
- **Navigation Made Easy:** Quickly go back to the blog form or explore existing posts via an intuitive navigation system.
- **Responsive Design:** The site is designed to work on any device, whether you’re on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Credits

This project was built as part of a Web APIs Challenge assignment for my coding bootcamp. I handled everything from the form submission logic to rendering blog posts on the page. Special thanks to the bootcamp for pushing me to learn practical JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.
